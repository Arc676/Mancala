.Sh DESCRIPTION
Mancala is a strategy game. A board containing
shells or pebbles is used. There are 6 small holes
on each side and two large holes on the ends. Half
the board belongs to each player. The aim is to get
as many pebbles into one's large pocket as possible
while preventing the opponent from doing the same.
.Pp
Each hole contains the same number of pebbles to
start (default is 4 but can be changed with the
.Fl p
flag).
The pebbles are removed from a chosen pocket and
dropped one by one into the next pockets until there
are no more pebbles.
.Pp
Captures:
If the last pebble dropped lands in an empty pocket on
one's half of the board, that pebble and all the contents
of the pocket directly opposite are moved into one's
large pocket.
.Pp
Free turns:
If the last pebble lands in one's large pocket, that player
gets another turn.
.Pp
If one has enough pebbles in a pocket, they might go
around the entire board. However, pebbles from one's
half are never dropped into the opponent's large
pocket. This pocket is skipped and the next pebble
is dropped into one's first pocket.

The board is printed automatically after
each move. By default, the board is only
printed when requested by the user.

Enable fast mode. If either player possesses more than half of the
total pebbles in the game, that player is automatically considered the
winner because it's impossible for the other player to win. In fast mode,
the game ends once a player comes into possession of more than 50% of the pebbles
rather than when a player runs out of pebbles.
.It Fl s
The second player goes first. By default,
the first player goes first. If 2 player

second.
